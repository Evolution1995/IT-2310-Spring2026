    <h1>Hello, Class!</h1>
<p>This is my first time doing HTML, so far i've liked it more then the first coding class i've taken.
    It seems pretty straight forward and easy to understand. I'm looking forward to learning more about it in this class.<br>
    I am <strong>excited</strong> to learn more about HTML!
